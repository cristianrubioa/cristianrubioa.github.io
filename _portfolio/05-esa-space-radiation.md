## Overview

Participation as a Citizen Scientist in the European Space Agency's (ESA) space medicine project focusing on the **Systematic Threat Analysis of Radiation from Space (STARTS)**.

## Project Description

The STARTS project aims to systematically review and classify existing scientific research to assess the risks of space radiation on the central nervous system (CNS) of astronauts. This research is critical for:

- Understanding non-neoplastic effects of ionizing radiation on the CNS
- Assessing long-term health risks for astronauts
- Contributing to the safety of future space exploration missions
- Supporting deep space mission planning (Moon, Mars, and beyond)

## My Contribution

As a Citizen Scientist, I collaborated in:

- **Literature Review:** Classification and analysis of scientific studies on space radiation
- **Data Analysis:** Systematic review of research findings
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of radiation effects on astronaut health
- **Documentation:** Contributing to the systematic review database

## Importance

Space radiation is one of the most significant challenges for long-duration space missions. Understanding its effects on the central nervous system is crucial for:

- Astronaut safety and health
- Mission planning and risk mitigation
- Development of protective measures
- Future deep space exploration (Artemis, Mars missions)

## Research Focus Areas

- **Non-neoplastic Effects:** Brain function changes, cognitive impacts
- **Ionizing Radiation:** Galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events
- **CNS Impact:** Neurological effects, long-term consequences
- **Human Space Exploration:** Safety protocols and countermeasures

## Technologies & Methods

- Systematic literature review methodologies
- Scientific database analysis
- Medical research classification
- Space medicine protocols
- Radiation biology

## Impact

This research directly contributes to:
- ESA's human spaceflight safety programs
- International space radiation protection standards
- Future mission planning for lunar and Martian exploration
- Scientific understanding of space radiation effects

## Organizations

- **ESA** (European Space Agency)
- **Space Medicine Community**
- **Citizen Science Network**

## Skills Developed

- Scientific literature review
- Space medicine knowledge
- Systematic research methodologies
- International collaboration
- Contribution to space exploration safety

## Related Work

This project aligns with international efforts to understand and mitigate space radiation risks, supporting programs like:
- NASA's Artemis Program
- ESA's Moon Village concept
- Future Mars exploration missions

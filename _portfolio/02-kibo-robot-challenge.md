## Overview

Participated in the 4th Kibo Robot Programming Challenge, an educational program organized by JAXA, NASA, and UNOOSA where students solve various problems by programming free-flying robots in the International Space Station (ISS).

## Project Description

The Kibo-RPC challenges participants to program autonomous robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball) that operate in the Japanese Experiment Module "Kibo" aboard the ISS. The program focuses on:

- Autonomous navigation in microgravity environments
- Computer vision and object detection
- Path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Real-time decision making in space conditions

## Objectives

- Learn cutting-edge methodologies in robotics and space technology
- Develop skills in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
- Gain experience programming robots for actual space missions
- Collaborate with international participants

## Technologies Used

- Robot Operating System (ROS)
- C++ / Python
- Computer Vision (OpenCV)
- Autonomous Navigation Algorithms
- Space Robotics Simulation

## Skills Developed

- Space robotics programming
- Autonomous systems development
- International collaboration
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Real-world space mission scenarios

## Impact

This program inspires students to develop their educational and professional goals to a higher level while expanding international exchange by encouraging interaction with participants from around the world.

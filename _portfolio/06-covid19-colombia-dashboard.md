## Overview

Desktop application developed at Universidad de Ibagué as a research response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing comprehensive data analysis and visualization tools for tracking the virus spread across Colombia.

## Project Description

A local, practical solution for analyzing COVID-19 cases in Colombia with real-time data from the National Institute of Health (INS). The application enables:

- **Data retrieval:** Total, recovered, and deceased cases by departments and municipalities
- **Trend analysis:** Evolution curves for confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases
- **Statistical distribution:** Case status, care type, importation type, origin, age, and gender
- **Geospatial visualization:** Interactive maps categorized by cities and municipalities
- **Predictive modeling:** Case projection and comparison of different COVID-19 models

## Key Features

- Real-time data integration from INS Colombia
- Interactive dashboards with multiple visualization types
- Geospatial mapping of infection zones
- Epidemiological curve tracking
- Comparative model analysis for outbreak prediction
- Standalone desktop application (no internet required after data download)

## Technologies Used

- **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)**
- **[App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html)** (GUI development)
- **Geospatial Analysis Tools**
